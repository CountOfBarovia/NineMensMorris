## Ancient strategy game

Place your pieces until all nine are on the board. Every time you make
a row of three, remove one of your opponent's pieces that is not already
in a row of three. Once all pieces are placed, on your turn, you may
move one piece along a line. Once you have only three left, the pieces
may move anywhere, not just along the lines.
